Dress rental system

Being girls and living in a society where we are expected to look good and attractive, especially in family events (specifically weddings); we face a lot of confusion.

Having many events coming up; getting a new and 'different' dress for each event can be a headache. This process takes up a lot of our time, effort, storage space and of course a lot of money.

And after wearing that dress once it cannot be repeated in the same gathering, thus, that dress is kept in the closet along with many other dresses which people have already seen.

This is definitely a waste of our precious resources which can be otherwise used more efficiently for the betterment of the society.

Considering this scenario we decided to make a program which is a dress rental management program. It keeps a record of all the dresses the rental shop has. It also keeps a registry of all the customers that has at any point in their lives rented a dress from that rental shop. Also it tracks every service detail (which customer has rented which dress). In the end, the program also prints a receipt for the customer.
